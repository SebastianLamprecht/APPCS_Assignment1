# Description
This is the project for the 1st Assignment in "Applied Computer Sciences" at the UAS Technikum Vienna.
The Project is a simulation of [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation) upon which multiple celestial systems such as the solar system, earth-moon system and the jupiter system will be simulated and animated.
Development by __Gurkirt Pal Lakhesar__ and __Sebastian Joey Lamprecht__ at the UAS Technikum Vienna (c).
